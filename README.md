## Notes

I used the lab as a starter file for my project. I learned that renaming a project in Xcode has a lot of steps and wrongfully doing so will cause the build to break. 

I also learned that I would need to have location services enabled in order to retrieve metadata from a picture taken using the in-app camera.
